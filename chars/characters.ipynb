    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Formation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Generative Agents have extended memories, stored in a single stream:\n",
    "      1. Observations - from dialogues or interactions with the virtual world, about self or others\n",
    "      2. Reflections - resurfaced and summarized core memories\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Recall**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Memories are retrieved using a weighted sum of salience, recency, and importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can review the definitions of the `GenerativeAgent` and `GenerativeAgentMemory` in the [reference documentation](\"../../reference/modules/experimental\") for the following imports, focusing on `add_memory` and `summarize_related_memories` methods."
